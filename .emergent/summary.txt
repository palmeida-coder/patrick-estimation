The AI engineer's work trajectory outlines a progression from bug resolution and comprehensive application testing to initiating real-world integration. Initially, the focus was on fixing a persistent frontend compilation error related to a missing 'Elevator' icon in , which required multiple attempts, including extensive cache clearing, force restarts, and eventually identifying and deleting a problematic backup file. This phase highlighted the tenacity of frontend caching issues. Following successful resolution and user confirmation, a full-stack testing cycle was initiated. Backend tests showed 89.1% success, with minor format adjustments needed for AI services, while frontend tests achieved 100% success, confirming all UI components and navigation were fully functional. The current phase involves transitioning the application to production, starting with real Google Sheets integration. This has been again interrupted by the re-emergence of the  icon compilation error, indicating a deep-seated cache or build system issue that the AI engineer is actively debugging with the assistance of a troubleshoot agent.

<product_requirements>
The Efficity application's primary goal is to empower real estate consultants and agency directors by streamlining lead generation, qualification, and management, alongside automating marketing efforts. The core problem it solves is optimizing lead workflow and anticipating sales intentions. The current application includes:
*   A centralized lead management dashboard.
*   Bi-directional Google Sheets integration for data handling.
*   Automated lead extraction from online platforms.
*   Intelligent behavioral detection and Patrick IA for sales project prediction.
*   Automated, personalized email sequences and follow-ups.
*   Configurable notifications system and real-time market intelligence.
*   Fully implemented External CRM Integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Monday, Zoho) with bi-directional synchronization.
*   A comprehensive RGPD Compliance module, covering consent and right to be forgotten.
*   Super-IA Patrick 3.0 with advanced Lead Scoring for precise lead qualification and a Lyon-specific Real Estate Price Predictor AI.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating the application with a **real Google Sheet** provided by the user, aiming to transition the Efficity application from a development/simulation state to a production-ready system with actual data.

The work completed for this phase includes:
1.  **Backend Service Creation**: A new Python file, , was created. This service is designed to connect to the user's existing Google Sheet ( with Leads tab) and perform bi-directional synchronization (CRUD operations).
2.  **Backend Integration**: The  module was imported into the main FastAPI application, . New API endpoints (e.g., , , etc.) were added to  to expose the functionalities of the real Google Sheets service.
3.  **Ongoing Issue**: During this integration process, a persistent frontend compilation error, specifically related to the  icon in , re-emerged (Chat 218). This issue has plagued the development intermittently, despite previous fixes including replacing the icon and clearing various caches. The AI engineer has identified this as a deeper, recurring problem, likely related to persistent webpack cache corruption or a hidden backup file, and has re-engaged the troubleshoot agent (Chat 221) to find a definitive solution. The backend has been restarted to apply code changes (Chat 217), but the frontend error persists, preventing full UI access and validation of the new Google Sheets integration.

<optional_next_step>
The immediate next step is to continue troubleshooting the persistent frontend  icon compilation error, following the troubleshoot agent's latest recommended steps to resolve the webpack dev server corruption.
