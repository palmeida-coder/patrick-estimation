The trajectory details the AI engineer's persistent efforts to stabilize and align the Efficity Lyon CRM with user expectations, facing numerous environment and deployment challenges. A recurring pattern was the AI engineer's initial declarations of success, which were consistently challenged by the user due to discrepancies between preview and production environments or incorrect UI. Key issues addressed included correcting MongoDB configuration, fixing an external lead form's API target, ensuring accurate email automation templates, and resolving critical frontend interface mismatches and metric inaccuracies across preview and production. The core challenge escalated from code-level fixes to platform-specific deployment and environment segregation issues, ultimately requiring intervention from Emergent support to clarify the distinct nature of preview and deployed applications and their databases, leading to a Duplicate Job and Replace Deployment strategy.

The Efficity application serves as a CRM for Lyon real estate, focused on automating lead management for particuliers vendeurs in specific Lyon arrondissements. The system, Efficity Lyon CRM v3.0, requires a zero manual intervention workflow for lead capture from external sources (specifically a GitHub Pages form) into the CRM. This process must trigger automated lead scoring (Patrick IA 3.0/4.0), personalized email sequences for prospects, and detailed notifications for Patrick Almeida (palmeida@efficity.com). A critical bug involved incorrect CTA links in automated emails and the external form submitting to the wrong backend URL. The desired final state is a stable Dashboard Einstein ⚡ Efficity Lyon Pro interface with specific metrics (111 pipeline leads, 78 hot leads, 7 conversions), a complete vertical sidebar with 13+ modules (e.g., Dashboard, Leads Lyon, Patrick IA, Automation), and full functionality for the GitHub form workflow, including accurate email templates and Google Sheets synchronization.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was grappling with a critical architectural discrepancy: the preview environment () correctly displayed the desired Dashboard Einstein with a vertical sidebar and accurate metrics (111, 78, 7, 0), while the production environment () persisted in showing an older, incorrect interface with horizontal navigation and branding issues, even after multiple code corrections and redeployments. Despite the backend functioning and the frontend code () being updated to reflect the correct UI (title, metrics, branding), the deployment process was not effectively syncing the preview's UI structure to production.

Emergent support clarified that preview and production environments utilize separate databases and configurations, meaning changes in preview are not automatically reflected in production. The last action received from the user was acknowledging the solution from Emergent support: to Duplicate Job from the correctly configured preview and then perform a Replace Deployment within this duplicated job. This process is expected to copy all data and configurations from the functional preview to the production environment, finally aligning the production UI with the desired sidebar verticale design. The system is functional in the preview environment, but the production environment still requires this specific deployment action to match.

The next step is to guide the user to Duplicate Job in the Emergent interface, then perform a Replace Deployment.
