The AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of debugging and feature implementation for the Efficity Lyon CRM, constantly challenged by environment inconsistencies and user expectations. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the UI (vertical sidebar) and external lead form submission to the correct backend endpoint. Key architectural decisions included using environment variables for all URLs and configuring FastAPI with a  prefix. The AI successfully implemented UI changes in  and addressed a critical bug in the GitHub Pages form, removing unintended  calls. However, persistent issues arose from the Emergent platform's deployment environment itself: production URLs were often inaccessible (DNS errors, Status 500) or conflicted with existing deployments. Despite numerous attempts to follow support recommendations (Duplicate Job, Replace Deployment, Fork + Replace), these infrastructure-level problems prevented a stable production deployment. Ultimately, the solution converged on using the functional preview environment () as the de facto production system, as it reliably housed all data and functionality, with explicit communication to the user about its stability and the need to engage Emergent support for long-term production URL resolution.

The Efficity Lyon CRM is designed to automate lead management for particuliers vendeurs in specific Lyon arrondissements, operating as Efficity Lyon CRM v3.0 with zero manual intervention. Leads originate from an external GitHub Pages form, triggering automated scoring via Patrick IA 3.0/4.0, personalized email sequences, and notifications to Patrick Almeida (). The application requires a Dashboard Einstein ⚡ Efficity Lyon Pro with specific metrics (111 pipeline leads, 78 hot leads, 7 conversions, 0 conversions), a vertical sidebar offering 13+ modules (Dashboard, Leads Lyon, Patrick IA, Automation), and seamless Google Sheets synchronization. Initial bugs included incorrect CTA links in emails and the external form submitting to the wrong backend URL. The system has since been updated to display the correct Dashboard Einstein UI with the vertical sidebar and dynamic metrics, and the GitHub form workflow, including email automation and Patrick's notifications, is fully operational on a stable preview environment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was navigating persistent infrastructure issues on the Emergent platform. The primary goal was to achieve a stable production deployment with the correct vertical sidebar UI and fully functional lead management workflow. Despite numerous attempts to use Emergent's deployment tools (, , ) and support's guidance, the production environment () remained problematic, primarily due to backend API inaccessibility (Status 500 errors) and a name conflict ( already active for ).

The frontend () was successfully modified to implement the desired vertical sidebar, display dynamic metrics, and correctly list leads (, ). The external GitHub Pages form () was also stabilized: it now correctly points to the functional preview backend URL (), its JavaScript has been fixed to prevent unintended  calls, and its original visual design (with Patrick Almeida's photo) has been accurately restored.

However, the core issue remained the production environment's instability. After multiple troubleshooting steps and direct communication with Emergent support, it became clear that the name conflict was not resolvable by the platform directly without a custom domain. Therefore, the current state dictates that the **preview environment () is the only 100% operational and stable solution for the Efficity Lyon CRM.** It successfully handles lead submissions, Patrick IA scoring, email automation, notifications to , and displays all 44 leads (including 3 real prospects) with the correct UI. The user has been advised to use this preview URL as their de facto production system while the underlying infrastructure problem persists, and a detailed email was drafted for the user to send to Emergent support to resolve the name conflict for a future, properly branded production URL.
