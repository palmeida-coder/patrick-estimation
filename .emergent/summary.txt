The AI engineer's trajectory primarily details a protracted battle with a persistent frontend compilation error related to a missing 'Elevator' icon in . This bug repeatedly re-emerged despite numerous attempts at resolution, including cache clearing, file recreation, and renaming properties. The core issue was eventually traced to a property named  in the JSON data, which webpack misinterpreted as an icon import. Throughout this, the  was frequently engaged, providing deeper diagnostic insights. Amidst this intensive debugging, the engineer also successfully integrated a real Google Sheets service into the backend and implemented a new Multi-Agency Management feature, completing both backend and frontend components. The trajectory concludes with the 'Elevator' error still persisting, indicating a deeply embedded problem.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into resolving a highly persistent frontend compilation error related to the  icon in . This bug, despite multiple previous resolutions and various troubleshooting attempts (cache clearing, force restarts, renaming icon imports), continued to re-emerge.

The most recent attempts to fix this recurring issue included:
1.  **Deleting and Recreating Component**: The problematic  was completely deleted and recreated from scratch (Chat 153-158) to ensure no hidden corruptions.
2.  **Extensive Cache Clearing**: All possible frontend caches (,  folder, yarn cache v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/cache for documentation about this command.) were aggressively cleared (Chat 159-164).
3.  **Property Renaming and Component Replacement**: The root cause was eventually identified as the property name  within the JSON object sent to the API, which somehow triggered an  icon import from . The file was renamed to  and the property  was changed to  (Chat 178-181, 201-204). The icon was also changed to .
4.  **Preventive CRACO Configuration**: A change was made to  to configure webpack's cache to use , preventing disk-based cache corruption (Chat 135-137).

Despite these comprehensive efforts, the *very last message* (Chat 220, 221) from the user, followed by the AI engineer's response (Chat 222), indicates that the Elevator compilation error *still persists* even after replacing the component and extensive cleaning, suggesting a deeper underlying issue or a residual file reference.

Concurrent with this intensive debugging, the AI engineer successfully implemented and integrated a new **Multi-Agency Management System**. This included creating  with full CRUD APIs and a dashboard, and integrating its frontend component () into  with new routes and navigation links. Backend tests for Multi-Agency Management passed with 100% success (Chat 102), and the frontend also displayed correctly with dummy data (Chat 122).

The next step is to rigorously investigate and definitively resolve the persistent Elevator compilation error as indicated by the user's latest report and the AI engineer's final statement.
