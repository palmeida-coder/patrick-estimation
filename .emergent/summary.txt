<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully expanded the Efficity real estate application through several key phases. Initially, the focus was on resolving a critical Google Sheets synchronization bug, which involved extensive debugging of column mapping, data consistency, and API usage. Following this, the engineer systematically implemented major features: an advanced notification system, intelligent email sequences and nurturing automation, and real-time market intelligence. Each phase involved creating new backend services (FastAPI), integrating them into  with dedicated API routes and background tasks, and developing corresponding React frontend components, which were then integrated into  with navigation links and routes. The development process was iterative, with the engineer frequently asking for user confirmation or proceeding with carte blanche based on expert logic. The work included comprehensive backend and frontend testing after each feature, ensuring functionality before moving to the next. The current task is the implementation of External CRM Integrations.

<product_requirements>
The user, an Efficity real estate consultant and agency director, needs an advanced software to generate and qualify high-potential vendor leads by anticipating sales intentions. The core problem is to streamline lead management, improve lead qualification, and automate marketing efforts.

The application requires:
*   A centralized dashboard for lead management.
*   Bi-directional Google Sheets integration for collaborative lead management.
*   Automated lead extraction from multi-diffusion platforms (SeLoger, PAP, Leboncoin) and social networks.
*   Intelligent behavioral detection for sales project prediction (3, 6, 9 months).
*   Automated personalized email and follow-ups.
*   Multi-source import/export capabilities.
*   Collaborative multi-agent qualification (annotation, scoring, task attribution).
*   Advanced analytics (qualification rates, pipeline, performance, report export).
*   RGPD compliance.
*   Personalization features.
*   Configurable notifications.

So far, the application has a centralized dashboard, full lead management, Efficity-branded email automation, a fully functional bi-directional Google Sheets synchronization, a basic AI behavioral engine, and an enhanced Patrick IA providing predictions and recommendations. The previous engineer has also implemented advanced analytics, multi-source lead extraction, a comprehensive notification system, intelligent email sequences, and real-time market intelligence.

-   ****: The main FastAPI application. This file is crucial as it integrates and initializes all new services. It was continuously updated to add new API routes (prefixed with ), new service imports (e.g., , , , ), and background tasks for automated processes within its startup events.
-   ****: **NEW.** Created to manage and send various notifications (Email, SMS, Slack, Push). It provides backend logic for the notification system.
-   ****: **NEW.** Created to orchestrate automated, intelligent email sequences based on lead behavior. It uses the existing  and integrates with . This file defines the core logic for nurturing campaigns.
-   ****: **NEW.** Implemented for real-time market data collection (e.g., competitive analysis, price trends). It provides crucial data to enhance email sequences and insights.
-   ****: **NEW.** (Currently being implemented) This service is being developed as a multi-CRM hub for Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive, handling bi-directional synchronization and workflow automation.
-   ****: The central React component. Heavily modified to import and integrate new frontend components, add their respective navigation links, and define  routes.
-   ****: **NEW.** Frontend component for managing notification settings and displaying logs. Its integration into  was completed.
-   ****: **NEW.** Frontend component providing a UI for managing and viewing intelligent email sequences. Its integration into  was completed.
-   ****: **NEW.** Frontend component for displaying real-time market intelligence dashboards and analytics. Its integration into  was completed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing **External CRM Integrations**. This is a major feature aimed at professionalizing the application by connecting it to popular CRM platforms like Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive, enabling bi-directional data synchronization and workflow automation.

The work accomplished so far in this phase includes:
1.  **Backend Service Creation**: A new Python file, , was successfully created. This service is intended to act as the core logic for handling multi-CRM connections.
2.  **Backend Integration into **:
    *   The  module has been imported into the main FastAPI application file, .
    *   API endpoints related to CRM integrations have been added to . These endpoints will expose functionalities for connecting, managing, and synchronizing with external CRMs.
    *   The  file was updated to include these new routes and integrate the service.
    *   The user acknowledged these backend changes (tout va bien - all good) after each update to .

The system is currently in a state where the backend service () has been initiated, and its integration into the main FastAPI application () for API routing is complete. The next step, as indicated by the last action, is to create the corresponding frontend component.
