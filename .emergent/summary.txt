The previous AI engineer meticulously advanced the Efficity application through several critical development phases. Initially, work focused on completing and stabilizing External CRM Integrations, which involved significant debugging of frontend visibility and navigation layout issues due to caching and environment mismatches. Following this, a robust RGPD Compliance Enterprise Module was implemented, requiring careful error correction in the backend (dataclass order, MongoDB object handling) to ensure legal adherence. The engineer then moved onto the Super-IA Patrick 3.0 project, first implementing an Advanced Lead Scoring AI, including its backend with  and a new frontend interface, resolving a minor icon import bug. Most recently, the focus shifted to the Lyon Price Predictor AI, where the backend service has been developed, integrated, and tested, and the frontend component created and integrated, with the final step being user confirmation of its visibility. The engineer consistently demonstrated a full-stack approach, iterative development, and diligent debugging.

The Efficity application aims to empower real estate consultants and agency directors by generating, qualifying, and managing high-potential vendor leads, while automating crucial marketing efforts. The core problem is to streamline lead management, enhance lead qualification, and automate marketing workflows to anticipate sales intentions.

Currently, the application features:
*   A centralized dashboard for comprehensive lead management.
*   Bi-directional Google Sheets integration for collaborative data handling.
*   Automated lead extraction from various online platforms.
*   Intelligent behavioral detection and Patrick IA for sales project prediction.
*   Automated, personalized email sequences and follow-ups.
*   Configurable notifications system.
*   Real-time market intelligence.
*   Fully implemented External CRM Integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Monday, Zoho) with bi-directional synchronization.
*   A comprehensive RGPD Compliance module, including consent management and right to be forgotten.
*   Super-IA Patrick 3.0 with advanced Lead Scoring for precise lead qualification.
*   Super-IA Patrick 3.0 also includes a Lyon-specific Real Estate Price Predictor AI (currently being finalized).

-   ****: The central FastAPI application. This file was continuously updated to integrate new services, initialize them during startup, and expose their functionalities via  routes. Significant changes include integration of CRM, RGPD, Patrick IA 3.0 (Lead Scoring), and Lyon Price Predictor services.
-   ****: **NEW.** A dedicated backend service created to manage multi-CRM connections, bi-directional data synchronization, and workflow automation.
-   ****: **NEW.** This backend service was implemented to handle GDPR compliance, including consent management, right to be forgotten (data deletion/anonymization), and audit reporting. It underwent significant debugging for dataclass field order and MongoDB ObjectId serialization issues.
-   ****: **NEW.** Developed for Patrick IA 3.0, this backend service implements a sophisticated lead scoring algorithm using , providing precise predictions on lead quality and closing probability.
-   ****: **NEW.** Created as part of Patrick IA 3.0, this backend service provides highly accurate real estate price predictions specific to the Lyon region, leveraging various local data sources.
-   ****: The main React application entry point. It was heavily modified to:
    *   Import and render new feature components: , , , and .
    *   Configure  routes (, , , ) to navigate to these new components.
    *   Add navigation links to the main menu bar, including icon imports (e.g., , , , ), and underwent UI adjustments for spacing and text shortening to optimize navigation layout.
-   ****: Modified to improve horizontal scrolling behavior and adjust spacing within the navigation bar for better UI presentation.
-   ****: **NEW.** Frontend component for the CRM integration dashboard, allowing users to view, configure, and manage CRM connections.
-   ****: **NEW.** Frontend component providing a user interface for RGPD compliance settings and transparency dashboards.
-   ****: **NEW.** Frontend component designed to display the advanced lead scoring insights and metrics generated by Patrick IA 3.0. A minor bug related to icon import () was fixed here.
-   ****: **NEW.** Frontend component providing the user interface to interact with the Lyon Price Predictor AI, allowing input of property details and displaying price prediction results.
-   ****: Updated to include  as a dependency for the AI services.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing the **Lyon Real Estate Price Predictor AI**, a key feature under the Super-IA Patrick 3.0 umbrella, specifically tailored for the Lyon region as per the user's latest strategic guidance.

The work completed so far in this phase includes:
1.  **Backend Service Development**: A new Python file, , has been successfully created. This service is designed to provide highly accurate real estate price predictions for properties in Lyon, leveraging various data points like location, property characteristics, and market trends.
2.  **Backend Integration**: The  module has been imported into the main FastAPI application, . Corresponding API endpoints, such as  for individual predictions and  for overall analytics, have been added to . The service initialization logic has also been integrated into the 's startup events.
3.  **Backend Verification**: The backend of the Lyon Price Predictor AI has been thoroughly tested using internal tools (). These tests confirmed that the prediction endpoint returns valid results (e.g., predicted price, confidence level, insights), and the dashboard endpoint provides accurate metrics (e.g., prediction accuracy, RÂ² score). The backend is deemed 100% functional.
4.  **Frontend Component Creation**: A new React component, , has been successfully created. This component will serve as the user interface for interacting with the Lyon Price Predictor, allowing users to input property details and view the AI's estimations and insights.
5.  **Frontend Integration**: The newly created  component has been integrated into the main React application, . This integration involved adding the component import, defining its route (), and adding a navigation link with an appropriate icon in the main application menu bar.

The current state is that the backend for the Lyon Price Predictor AI is fully functional and integrated. The frontend component has been developed and integrated into the application's navigation. The last action performed by the AI engineer was restarting the frontend service () to ensure all recent UI changes are applied and visible to the user. The AI is awaiting the user's confirmation that they can now see and access the Lyon Price Predictor tab and its features in their browser, indicated by the user's toujours la () response after the restart.
