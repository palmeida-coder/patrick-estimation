<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed an MVP for a real estate prospecting application for an Efficity consultant. The work progressed in phases, starting with core lead management and then adding intelligent integrations. Key achievements include a functional dashboard, comprehensive lead management (creation, status, scoring), and a robust technical architecture (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB). Email automation was implemented using Emergent AI, followed by bi-directional Google Sheets synchronization. Most recently, an advanced AI behavioral engine was integrated, creating Patrick IA for conversational assistance and detailed lead analysis. The current focus is debugging a column mapping issue in the Google Sheets synchronization, ensuring data, including assigned agent and scores, aligns correctly after import/export.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving a bug related to the Google Sheets synchronization feature. While the Google Sheets integration was declared complete and functional, and leads were successfully syncing, the user identified an issue where the synced data's columns were misaligned, and specific data points (like Patrick Almeida for Agent Assigné and Score Qualité) were appearing in incorrect columns or duplicated. The AI engineer attempted to correct the column mapping in the backend. The last few messages indicate the user provided a screenshot (not shown in the trajectory) to help diagnose the exact column alignment issue. The AI engineer acknowledges the problem and is awaiting a second capture to fully understand and fix the column mapping to ensure accurate data import and display in the Google Sheet. The application currently has a fully operational dashboard, lead management, email automation, Google Sheets integration (though bugged with mapping), basic AI behavioral analysis (lightning button), and an advanced AI behavioral engine with a conversational assistant (brain button).
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step will be to analyze the user's second screenshot of the Google Sheet columns and correct the backend's data mapping logic to ensure precise alignment and import of lead details.
